# Sample configuration file for cue2toc. Copy this file to ~/.cue2tocrc
#
# Arguments to options must be quoted if they contain whitespace
# characters. To include a double quote in a quoted string, precede it
# with a backslash.

# Files specified in the CUE file can automatically be converted by
# cue2toc. If the file name ends with the string given as the first
# argument to one of the CONVERTER options below, the command given
# as the third argument is executed. The environment will contain
# the variables C2T_FROM (the file name from the CUE file) and C2T_TO
# (the same file name with the extension matching the first argument
# replaced with the extension given as the second argument). The
# comparison of the file name extension is not case sensitive. This
# configuration option can occur multiple times and has no default
# value. If multiple converters match a file name the first one will
# be used.

CONVERTER = .mp3 .wav "lame --decode \"$C2T_FROM\" \"$C2T_TO\" >/dev/null 2>&1"
CONVERTER = .ogg .wav "oggdec -o \"$C2T_TO\" \"$C2T_FROM\" >/dev/null 2>&1"

# Automatically convert files according to the rules specified with
# the CONVERTER option above. Default is "yes".

CONVERT = yes

# Normally cue2toc dispalys warning messages for unsupported commands
# and constructs which are not fatal (they are simply ignored). When
# converting data files a message is displayed for every file going
# to be converted. Setting this option to "yes" disables these warnings
# and messages. The default is "no".

QUIET = no

# Write CD-Text data to TOC file if present in the CUE file. Default
# is "yes".

CDTEXT = yes

 * A PREGAP of zero length is now ignored as it is useless and cdrdao
   would not accept it. Thanks to Ken Arromdee for pointing this out.

cue2toc 0.3 -- 2004-04-04

 * Files specified in the CUE file can now be automatically converted

   extension.

 * A new configuration file in the users home directory to configure
   the converters mentioned above.

 * The -w option to specify a file name to use for all audio tracks is
   gone.
